## YOUR ANU ID: u6527752
## YOUR NAME: Chunhao Li

## Implement the function interpolate below.
## (The statement "pass" is just a placeholder that does nothing: you
## should replace it.)
## You can define other functions if it helps you decompose the problem
## and write a better organised and/or more readable solution.

def interpolate(x, y, x_test):
    pass

## REMEMBER THAT THIS FILE (WHEN YOU SUBMIT IT) MUST NOT CONTAIN ANYTHING
## OTHER THAN YOUR FUNCTION DEFINITION AND COMMENTS. You can (and should)
## use docstrings to document your functions, but a docstring should only
## be used inside a function definition, an then only at the very beginning
## of the function suite. Everywhere else you should use comments.
